# scalemate

A simple tool that lets you generate two Major and two minor scales and gives you the functionality to add it to your iPhone Calendar for the next week so you can practice all your scales.

The scales are randomly suggested. The user can only regenerate three times and then it is practice time. 

Have fun! ðŸŽ¹
